# VIPER: Video and Image-based Pose Estimation (Pre-Cursor)
A Blender addon that uses Google's Mediapipe Face Landmarker to map facial expressions onto a 3D character in real time. This Facial Motion Capture Addon is a pre-cursor to my 3D human pose estimation model, VIPER (Video and Image-based Pose Estimation), which I hope to release within the next year or so.
